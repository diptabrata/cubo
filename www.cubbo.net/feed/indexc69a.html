<div style="text-align: center;">Born in Barcelona, Lexlay has been showing the world his own way of understanding music for more than a decade. After years of work and driven by his resourceful character he´s been placed in a respectable position in the national electronic music scene.<br />
Lexlay is a synonym for joy, energy, freshness and passion; entertainment and fun are guaranteed on his sets. Versatile like a chameleon, he manages his musical discourse and adapts it to what each club crowd demands carrying with it a collective outburst of emotions. Elegance and pace characterize his musical style, being able to toggle from the sensitivity of “house music” to a more “groovy techno”. Venues and prestigious clubs which require his services increase every day, proof of it are his performances in places such as: Space, Pacha, Privilege (Ibiza), Fabrik (Madrid), Florida 135, Elrow; shared poster with the likes of Carl Cox, Richie Hawtin, Luciano, Marco Carola, Loco Dice, among others. This 2016 has been acting in more than 50 cities around the world.<br />
He is currently a responsible and founder member of the recognized brand Happy Techno, which along with his crew, has conquered the audience of Barcelona by hosting the Saturday night event in one of the most emblematic clubs in town, City Hall.<br />
Also immersed into perfecting his works when we get to talk about music production, as well as focused on the achievement of making his record label “HappyTechno Music” grow. He has released tracks on several, national and international labels, highlighting the work done for Snatch! Records, Material Series &amp; Stereo Productions.</div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">Marcos, better known as DJ Murphy, started djing in 1992 influenced by acid-house and hip-hop. On the following year he began his professional career playing house, hardcore and jungle at Sao Paulo&#8217;s suburbs. Still in the early 90&#8217;s he decided to play only techno.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It is impossible not to associate one of the greatest and most skilled DJs in the world with the Brazillian dance music scene. Chosen by DJ Sound magazine in 2006 for the second time as best DJ in Brazil, Murphy is the kind of DJ that once on stage can perform magic on the decks, hypnotizing everyone with his unique technique!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Known by his totally original performances and by his Techno, which is filled with scratches and mixes of three and sometimes even four songs at the same time, Murphy is a DJ that conquered the world with presentations in more than 30 countries.</p>

<p>Another chapter gets added to the ever increasing roster of talent, that&#8217;s strongly shaping up the foundations of Pursuit.On the heels of his debut EP, Dennis Apec is delivering once again a peak time monolith. A true euphoric smorgasbord of melodies and thunderous beats only he can deliver. Switching gears, Rob Hes welcomes the talented LAAT to Pursuit. After a slew of releases that the two released together, they are back once again to bring you Creepin. A melodic behemoth that is showcasing what happens when these two forces join in the studio.</p>
<p>Friends of the family Duss bring us another acid infused hypnotizer that is surely delivering the goods, whereas Berlanga also makes his return after his recent Sismo EP, to give us the excellent Tacana.<br />
And for closing duties we welcome new kids on the block 2088 and Comunica, both bringing us that dark brooding sound that we at Pursuit are all about. Please enjoy this collective of art and dedication.</p>
