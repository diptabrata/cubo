								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Rave Jungle had the opportunity to have an exclusive interview with the Brazilian super-talented Techno &amp; Hard Techno DJ and producer, Fernanda Martins. Despite her busy schedule she sat down with us and was kind enough to answer some of your most compelling questions.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">During our conversation, the Techno superstar opens up about her passion for Techno music, her own label DEVOTION, her future plans and gigs and many more</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Hi Fernanda, you are touring a lot – How does it feel being so much around?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Well, it feels super good! It’s really nice to travel around, arrive in some unexpected places and see there are lots of people waiting to listen to you. I must say that some weeks are hard… When we are on tour, sometimes our body and mind get tired and, during some gigs, is like we arrive in the cabin in ¨automatic mode¨. Sometimes you think ¨God! I will not be able to play 3 hrs. now! I slept just 1 hour!¨… But once you start playing everything changes, for good! … (It doesn’t mean you are going to suffer the consequences after heheheh).</em></p>
