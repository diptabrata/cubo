								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="https://www.cubbo.net/music/christian-smith/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.cubbo.net/music/christian-smith/">Christian Smit</a><a href="https://www.cubbo.net/music/christian-smith/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.cubbo.net/music/christian-smith/">h</a></strong> has had an outstanding summer with festivals and club gig all over the world. To top this off he managed to do something very few can there days, have a successful weekly Ibiza residency! His 16 week residency has had guests ranging from <strong>Ben Sims</strong> to <strong>Deborah De Luca</strong>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/93fb1b7e55c019d88e6579cd2/images/96168d1b-1617-4feb-a953-589d4bf3a834.png" width="344" height="346" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;I tried to come up with a concept that fits into a super club but has nothing to do with VIP high ticket prices etc. I felt that if I get involved into something in Ibiza it needed to go back to its roots because many of the big clubs have been taking advantage of the clubbers for years and it became more about the glamour than the music. I am ecstatic to say that our first season has been a big success, and that we will be back in 2020 for a <strong>20 week residency!</strong>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/93fb1b7e55c019d88e6579cd2/images/a22aea67-0d47-4fce-a35d-9ecf2e02db81.png" width="298" height="267" /><br />
Tronic is having events all over the globe with confirmed dates that fall into <strong>London, Zurich, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Tokyo, Osaka, Berlin</strong>, and beyond.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.cubbo.net/5592/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/93fb1b7e55c019d88e6579cd2/images/17568a9e-e748-41e7-8515-b227857839b3.png" width="370" height="371" /></a><br />
We are very proud to have the legend, <strong>Laurent Garnier</strong>, do a remix for us. He made an elegant, timeless, piece of techno for <strong><a href="https://www.cubbo.net/music/christian-smith/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.cubbo.net/music/christian-smith/">Christian </a><a href="https://www.cubbo.net/music/christian-smith/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.cubbo.net/music/christian-smith/">Smith</a></strong>&#8216;s &#8220;<strong>Air Castle</strong>&#8221; Track. Mr. Garnier has been a big support for Tronic for over 20 years and we feel privileged that he agreed to make remix for us.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">We are glad to announce the newest member of the CUBBO artist pool.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">After more than a decade focused 100% on electronic music, <a href="https://www.cubbo.net/music/baum/">Baum</a> is on the crest of wave in his professional career, both behind the decks and in the studio. Hisdedication and passion for music can be seen in all his projects, especially when he’s in front of a packed dancefloor.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">As a DJ, the sole purpose of <a href="https://www.cubbo.net/music/baum/">Baum</a>’s music is to make people dance. His sound is sometimes closer to tech, others to deep; festive or sober, accessible or dark, classic or sophisticated but it’s always house music and always gets people moving. His skills as a DJ have led to a residency with elrow, one of the industry&#8217;s most powerful night life brands. His sets at Las Filipinas, the space that elrow has in Barcelona and Ibiza for the most housy sound, have led to him becoming one of the most sought-after DJs with dates in different clubs around Spain as well as the rest of Europe, America and the Middle East.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">When it comes to his music production, <a href="https://www.cubbo.net/music/baum/">Baum</a> combines different facets; he’s an accomplished producer in his own right, his tracks can be found on labels such as Repopulate Mars, Mother Recordings or Sola. Secondly as A&amp;R and artist as well for labels like elrow music (currently) or Suara (for five years). And finally, with his own label, Baumhaus, he seeks out and discovers talented new producers in Spain and internationally with a sound that will fits within his sets.In a few words, <a href="https://www.cubbo.net/music/baum/">Baum</a> is a true music lover who lives and breathes electronic music 24/7.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>We are glad to announce the newest member of the CUBBO artist pool.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.cubbo.net/music/drumcomplex/">Drumcomplex</a> aka Arnd Reichow is a techno DJ, producer and label head of Complexed Records. Active since the late 90’s, he is one of Germany’s most dedicated techno purveyors with a body of work reaching crowds in his home country as well as beyond.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Hoarding two and a half decades-worth of music experience under his belt, Arnd Reichow has been crafting his space within the techno industry, as artist and producer and adding label owner to his accolades since 2014. Arnd’s choice of monikers, both in his and his label’s, defines his vision of music: techno is a quintessentially complex matter, amounting to diverse layers that rack up all aspects of the topic. On the one hand, there is the craftsmanship that comes with applying and enhancing your skills over hours upon hours of studio work, polishing details and refining directions. This is evident when looking at Drumcomplex’s discography, with releases throughout the years on seminal labels such as Carl Cox’s Intec Digital, Monika Kruse’s Terminal M or Andre Crom’s OFF Recordings. What stands out is his Atomic track, the 2018 club hit which garnered extensive play from the likes of Amelie Lens, Joseph Capriati and many more around the globe. On Complexed records we also find a bountiful of fruitful releases, which have generated the freshly minted label a steady following.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Complementing the fruits of studio labor, and, arguably, a litmus test of any piece of sound escapism, is the dancefloor test-drive. And the German artist has arduously served his due floor time, keeping up a constant schedule of gigs within the borders, as well as outside of Germany. Recent highlight include Carl Cox’s prestigious last Revolution Party at the infamous Space Ibiza, the legendary Awakenings Festival in Amsterdam’s beloved Gashouder, and the list continues on anticipating his upcoming 2019 appearances, which have already filled up the artist’s calendar.</p>
