								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">Marcos, better known as DJ Murphy, started djing in 1992 influenced by acid-house and hip-hop. On the following year he began his professional career playing house, hardcore and jungle at Sao Paulo&#8217;s suburbs. Still in the early 90&#8217;s he decided to play only techno.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It is impossible not to associate one of the greatest and most skilled DJs in the world with the Brazillian dance music scene. Chosen by DJ Sound magazine in 2006 for the second time as best DJ in Brazil, Murphy is the kind of DJ that once on stage can perform magic on the decks, hypnotizing everyone with his unique technique!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Known by his totally original performances and by his Techno, which is filled with scratches and mixes of three and sometimes even four songs at the same time, Murphy is a DJ that conquered the world with presentations in more than 30 countries.</p>
