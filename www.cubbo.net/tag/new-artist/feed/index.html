								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">We are glad to announce the newest member of the CUBBO artist pool.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Hamburg based duo Kaiserdisco have established themselves as one of Germany&#8217;s top exports to come out of the last decade. The synergy between Frederic and Patrick has resulted in a successful and consistent release schedule on many top labels including Drumcode, Get Physical Suara Terminal M and Tronic and an endless list of top notch remixes. True to their roots they always deliver when it comes to no-nonsense powerful techno beats with an infectious rhythm. Kaiserdisco is all about stimulating the audience to get everyone dancing and have fun. It was back in 2010 success came in the form of a landmark debut release on Drumcode. Since they have now accumulated a total of 6 EP’s on Adam Beyers imprint, it was only natural that the pair would form their own musical outlet and so KD Music and KD Raw were established. Accumulating over 100 releases collectively both labels consistently appears in Beatport techno charts. Their output of music continues to evolve remaining current and creative. With exciting collaborations and new EP’s to be announced Kaiserdisco don’t plan to hit the brakes anytime soon.</p>
