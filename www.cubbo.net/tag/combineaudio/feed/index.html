<div class="interior-expandable" style="text-align: center;">New on Paula Cazenave&#8217;s label Combine Audio is an EP from Ken Ishii, who amongst his many achievements is famed for pioneering techno in Japan and the southern hemisphere.<br />
Ken Ishii started his career in the early &#8217;90s and was a regular feature on the iconic label R&amp;S Records. His back catalogue also includes many other great imprints ranging from Tronic to Harthouse.<br />
Along with many solo tracks Ken Ishii has also collaborated with many artists often with backgrounds in other electronic genres, and one such example of this is the collaborative album he did with Marc Romboy for Systematic Recordings. One of the best known DJ&#8217;s and most respected electronic music producers to have broken out of Japan, this two track EP showcases the talents of a true techno innovator.<br />
Also on the EP is a remix from label boss Paula Cazenave who is a regular DJ at many clubs around Spain plus other parts of Europe, and her productions have also been turning heads following releases on labels ranging from Different is Different to Rotterdam based Patterns.<br />
The original mix of &#8220;Diode&#8221; has a bleeping synth line and mechanical percussion at the heart of its stripped back analogue sound. With an intense sense of urgency, the track builds tension using modulating tones set to whip a dance floor into a frenzy.<br />
Paula Cazenave remixes &#8220;Diode&#8221; using a tougher kick drum sample that solidifies a platform for her punchy version. Focusing on the groove of the original&#8217;s synth line, she also adds a heavy clap and rhythmical atmospherics into her hypnotic rework full of brooding menace.Grab your copy here:<br />
