								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="https://www.cubbo.net/music/christian-smith/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.cubbo.net/music/christian-smith/">Christian Smit</a><a href="https://www.cubbo.net/music/christian-smith/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.cubbo.net/music/christian-smith/">h</a></strong> has had an outstanding summer with festivals and club gig all over the world. To top this off he managed to do something very few can there days, have a successful weekly Ibiza residency! His 16 week residency has had guests ranging from <strong>Ben Sims</strong> to <strong>Deborah De Luca</strong>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;I tried to come up with a concept that fits into a super club but has nothing to do with VIP high ticket prices etc. I felt that if I get involved into something in Ibiza it needed to go back to its roots because many of the big clubs have been taking advantage of the clubbers for years and it became more about the glamour than the music. I am ecstatic to say that our first season has been a big success, and that we will be back in 2020 for a <strong>20 week residency!</strong>&#8220;</p>

Tronic is having events all over the globe with confirmed dates that fall into <strong>London, Zurich, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Tokyo, Osaka, Berlin</strong>, and beyond.</p>

We are very proud to have the legend, <strong>Laurent Garnier</strong>, do a remix for us. He made an elegant, timeless, piece of techno for <strong><a href="https://www.cubbo.net/music/christian-smith/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.cubbo.net/music/christian-smith/">Christian </a><a href="https://www.cubbo.net/music/christian-smith/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.cubbo.net/music/christian-smith/">Smith</a></strong>&#8216;s &#8220;<strong>Air Castle</strong>&#8221; Track. Mr. Garnier has been a big support for Tronic for over 20 years and we feel privileged that he agreed to make remix for us.</p>
